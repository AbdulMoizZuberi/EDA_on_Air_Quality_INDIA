# EDA on Air Quality (India)

## 📌 Overview

This project explores air quality data across India. The goal is to understand how clean or polluted the air is in different cities, what factors affect it, and how the data itself looks. Instead of building a predictive model, this project focuses on finding patterns, trends, and insights through analysis and visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Examine air quality data collected from different cities and stations in India.

Identify which pollutants (like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Ozone) are most common.

Understand missing or incomplete data in the dataset.

Visualize pollution trends over time and across regions.

Provide insights that can help raise awareness about environmental conditions.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains daily air quality data for multiple Indian cities and monitoring stations. It includes:

Date of observation

City and Station names

Pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Ozone, etc.)

Other features linked to air quality

## 🔎 Work Done

The analysis in this notebook includes:

Data Cleaning – handling missing or invalid values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – looking at the overall distribution of pollutants.

Missing Data Patterns – identifying which pollutants have large gaps in reporting.

Time Series Trends – studying how pollution levels change over days/months.

City & Station Comparisons – comparing pollution across regions.

Visual Insights – graphs and charts for easy understanding.

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Examples)

Some pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 are recorded more frequently, while others have missing values.

Certain cities show consistently higher pollutant levels compared to others.

Seasonal variations can be observed in air quality trends.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)

Geopy and Folium (Mapping of data on Global Map)
